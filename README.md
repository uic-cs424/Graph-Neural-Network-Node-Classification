This repository provides the code to implement and train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on your dataset. The task is framed as a node-level multiclass classification problem, where each table is represented as a directed graph, with each cell acting as a node. The GNN model uses the full training dataset's supergraph to learn node embeddings and predict the class of each node based on the edge connections and node data.

To run the experiment, follow these steps:

Install the required libraries and dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Upload your dataset as data.csv in the root directory.
Run main.py.
Visualization files will be generated in the root directory. Example visualizations from previous experiments can be found already.
